1270062575833640960 2020-06-08 18:38:09 UTC <elonmusk> Weâ€™re working on new legs. Wider stance & able to auto-level. Important for leaning into wind or landing on rocky & pitted surfaces.
1270061515094155264 2020-06-08 18:33:56 UTC <elonmusk> Forward thrusters are to stabilize ship when landing in high winds. If goal is max payload to moon per ship, no heatshield or flaps or big gas thruster packs are needed. No need to bring early ships back. They can serve as part of moon base alpha.
1270060054826192901 2020-06-08 18:28:08 UTC <elonmusk> Absolutely
1270059745538265088 2020-06-08 18:26:54 UTC <elonmusk> Outcome-based contracting with multiple competitors is vastly better than cost-plus (especially if sole-sourced), as the former rewards results & latter rewards waste. Outcome contracting should be applied broadly within government. The difference in results will be incredible.
1270057678744678400 2020-06-08 18:18:41 UTC <elonmusk> Wow, this is extremely important!! https://twitter.com/jimbridenstine/status/1270055378613612545Â â€¦

1270049671046508544 2020-06-08 17:46:52 UTC <elonmusk> Autopilot prime directive is: donâ€™t crash. What seems fast to humans is slow to a computer. 360 degree low light vision & sonar, plus forward radar enable to be superhuman. Upcoming software upgrades will increasingly show the potential.

1270026689272147968 2020-06-08 16:15:33 UTC <elonmusk> And those who werenâ€™t expecting a ternary joke
1269761768265445376 2020-06-07 22:42:51 UTC <elonmusk> Mars has an amazing amount of water ice

1269437518950182912 2020-06-07 01:14:24 UTC <elonmusk> Yeah. Even stacking on the pad will be quite an adventure!
1269434513085485058 2020-06-07 01:02:27 UTC <elonmusk> Creating the production system is >1000% harder than building one rocket. This is the truly hard thing.
1269432762676604928 2020-06-07 00:55:30 UTC <elonmusk> Itâ€™s insane
1269430935239266304 2020-06-07 00:48:14 UTC <elonmusk> Pursuing all three. Hard to say right now.
