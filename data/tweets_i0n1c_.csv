1240085436439003136 2020-03-18 01:19:42 UTC <i0n1c> Don‚Äôt worry you don‚Äôt look a day older  than 43 üëçüèª
1240069693437665280 2020-03-18 00:17:08 UTC <i0n1c> I meanwhile learned that Singapore doesn‚Äôt support it (yet?)
1240069430622580736 2020-03-18 00:16:06 UTC <i0n1c> It sucks a lot when you hear that even in Germany friends/family might lose their job over #covid19 - still better than losing their life though.
1240068955173056512 2020-03-18 00:14:12 UTC <i0n1c> The question is how they have CT scans before the illness. Because the patients usually only get to hospital after signs of pneumonia. Also the sample size of 12 is just too low
1240068571750752258 2020-03-18 00:12:41 UTC <i0n1c> Haha yeah i have done a lung capacity test because due to allergy i used to have breathing problems a lot when younger. I just don‚Äôt know how they have some comparisons
1239933922667982848 2020-03-17 15:17:38 UTC <i0n1c> They looked at 12 recovered patients and 2 or 3 had reduced lung capacity (how do they even know the state of lung before and how do they know it is permanent) https://twitter.com/chriseng/status/1239931462897541125¬†‚Ä¶
1239820854277496832 2020-03-17 07:48:21 UTC <i0n1c> I must be doing something wrong because of i want to use my phone as express travel card in #Singapore it still requires double clicking.
1239754236964958208 2020-03-17 03:23:38 UTC <i0n1c> For the account.
1239741094155313153 2020-03-17 02:31:24 UTC <i0n1c> Hey @dbs_care is it normal that 17 of march there is no estatement for the previous month (February) yet?
1239740471003344896 2020-03-17 02:28:56 UTC <i0n1c> Well when you look in Japanese history books you will miss a bunch of chapters.
1239736925549809664 2020-03-17 02:14:50 UTC <i0n1c> With the quarantine @youtube and @twitch and @pornhub likely have the time of their life.
1239735928962183169 2020-03-17 02:10:53 UTC <i0n1c> The same government who controls school books and how they portray the history and world war 2 ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è https://twitter.com/hirokotabuchi/status/1239602529547300864¬†‚Ä¶
1239733947220676613 2020-03-17 02:03:00 UTC <i0n1c> I must say i am a bit puzzled by #Singapore travel banning europe but not US who are finally starting to get people tested and are already at over 4000 cases with potentially tens if thousands beint already infected.
1239728998462054403 2020-03-17 01:43:20 UTC <i0n1c> Just cancel the damn olympics. Maybe that makes them wake up. https://twitter.com/pinboard/status/1239727233347932160¬†‚Ä¶
1239725237622542336 2020-03-17 01:28:24 UTC <i0n1c> So starting today my hometown in #germany even closes restaurants. I guess this is required seeing how it spreads and people still not waking up.
1239724332592463873 2020-03-17 01:24:48 UTC <i0n1c> It is impossible to prevent someone like patient 31 who intentionally went to crowded areas to infect as many as possible. https://twitter.com/ExcludedMuddle/status/1239719454222630912¬†‚Ä¶
1239403296026021894 2020-03-16 04:09:07 UTC <i0n1c> Well the CEO of that company was US american. he really met POTUS to talk about vaccine beginning of March. Then one week later he was replaced as CEO without explanation by one of the founders of the company.
1239379088541765632 2020-03-16 02:32:55 UTC <i0n1c> I would urge social networks like @InterNationsorg to shutdown the ability to create offline events for a while.
1239379085337317376 2020-03-16 02:32:55 UTC <i0n1c> A bunch of members of @InterNationsorg are just nuts. They keep creating events to gather and meet in groups in public. And then the description says nonsense like:if you feel unwell don‚Äôt attend.When will it get into their heads that you can have and spread the virus long before
1239361010743406592 2020-03-16 01:21:05 UTC <i0n1c> Yeah i mentioned it in other tweet already - but it is officially unknown why he was replaced. So any guess to why is just a guess/hope
