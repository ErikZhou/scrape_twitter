1270071794628726784 2020-06-08 19:14:47 UTC <realDonaldTrump> ...Crooked Hillary Clinton in 2016. They are called SUPPRESSION POLLS, and are put out to dampen enthusiasm. Despite 3 ½ years of phony Witch Hunts, we are winning, and will close it out on November 3rd! pic.twitter.com/4IhuLUZjsv
1270071785392943105 2020-06-08 19:14:45 UTC <realDonaldTrump> I have retained highly respected pollster, McLaughlin & Associates, to analyze todays CNN Poll (and others), which I felt were FAKE based on the incredible enthusiasm we are receiving. Read analysis for yourself. This is the same thing they and others did when we defeated...
1270018789250400257 2020-06-08 15:44:09 UTC <realDonaldTrump> This year has seen the lowest crime numbers in our Country’s recorded history, and now the Radical Left Democrats want to Defund and Abandon our Police. Sorry, I want LAW & ORDER!
1270015726502457349 2020-06-08 15:31:59 UTC <realDonaldTrump> Big day for Stock Market. Smart money, and the World, know that we are heading in the right direction. Jobs coming back FAST. Next year will be our greatest ever!
1269978005931282433 2020-06-08 13:02:06 UTC <realDonaldTrump> 96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you!
1269976902665752576 2020-06-08 12:57:43 UTC <realDonaldTrump> The Lamestream Media refuses to talk about our Country’s record setting Jobs Numbers, which are indicating GREATNESS, and soon!
1269974605059555328 2020-06-08 12:48:35 UTC <realDonaldTrump> CNN Polls are as Fake as their Reporting. Same numbers, and worse, against Crooked Hillary. The Dems would destroy America!
1269970808329437185 2020-06-08 12:33:30 UTC <realDonaldTrump> LAW & ORDER, NOT DEFUND AND ABOLISH THE POLICE. The Radical Left Democrats have gone Crazy!
1269970024908894209 2020-06-08 12:30:23 UTC <realDonaldTrump> Tremendous sincerity, what a guy. Hard to believe, with this kind of political talent, his numbers would “tank” so badly in Utah! https://twitter.com/hannah_natanson/status/1269742337934217219 …
1269841849038114816 2020-06-08 04:01:03 UTC <realDonaldTrump> Actually, a great book by a great and highly respected historian, Doug Wead! https://twitter.com/robot_amazon/status/1269840263658291205 …
1269840254871142400 2020-06-08 03:54:43 UTC <realDonaldTrump> Could it be even remotely possible that in Roger Goodell’s rather interesting statement of peace and reconciliation, he was intimating that it would now be O.K. for the players to KNEEL, or not to stand, for the National Anthem, thereby disrespecting our Country & our Flag?
1269837128059453440 2020-06-08 03:42:18 UTC <realDonaldTrump> Colin Powell was a pathetic interview today on Fake News CNN. In his time, he was weak & gave away everything to everybody - so bad for the USA. Also got the “weapons of mass destruction” totally wrong, and you know what that mistake cost us? Sad! Only negative questions asked.
1269761532033937412 2020-06-07 22:41:54 UTC <realDonaldTrump> If I wasn’t constantly harassed for three years by fake and illegal investigations, Russia, Russia, Russia, and the Impeachment Hoax, I’d be up by 25 points on Sleepy Joe and the Do Nothing Democrats. Very unfair, but it is what it is!!!

1269733556865118211 2020-06-07 20:50:45 UTC <realDonaldTrump> Opinion Editor at @nytimes just walked out. That’s right, he quit over the excellent Op-Ed penned by our great Senator @TomCottonAR. TRANSPARENCY! The State of Arkansas is very proud of Tom. The New York Times is Fake News!!!
1269730875769487361 2020-06-07 20:40:05 UTC <realDonaldTrump> “If Biden had any passion or respect for law enforcement, he kept it well hidden in his Philadelphia address. He criticized cops far more than he did arsonists & looters.” Michael Goodwin, @nypost
