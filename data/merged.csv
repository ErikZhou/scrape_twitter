2020-03-16 10:02:05 UTC <wentommy> 哈哈
2020-03-18 00:17:08 UTC <i0n1c> I meanwhile learned that Singapore doesn’t support it (yet?)
2020-03-18 00:16:06 UTC <i0n1c> It sucks a lot when you hear that even in Germany friends/family might lose their job over #covid19 - still better than losing their life though.
2020-03-18 00:14:12 UTC <i0n1c> The question is how they have CT scans before the illness. Because the patients usually only get to hospital after signs of pneumonia. Also the sample size of 12 is just too low
2020-03-18 00:12:41 UTC <i0n1c> Haha yeah i have done a lung capacity test because due to allergy i used to have breathing problems a lot when younger. I just don’t know how they have some comparisons
2020-03-17 15:17:38 UTC <i0n1c> They looked at 12 recovered patients and 2 or 3 had reduced lung capacity (how do they even know the state of lung before and how do they know it is permanent) https://twitter.com/chriseng/status/1239931462897541125 …
2020-03-17 07:48:21 UTC <i0n1c> I must be doing something wrong because of i want to use my phone as express travel card in #Singapore it still requires double clicking.
2020-03-17 03:23:38 UTC <i0n1c> For the account.
2020-03-17 02:31:24 UTC <i0n1c> Hey @dbs_care is it normal that 17 of march there is no estatement for the previous month (February) yet?
2020-03-17 02:28:56 UTC <i0n1c> Well when you look in Japanese history books you will miss a bunch of chapters.
2020-03-17 02:14:50 UTC <i0n1c> With the quarantine @youtube and @twitch and @pornhub likely have the time of their life.
2020-03-17 02:10:53 UTC <i0n1c> The same government who controls school books and how they portray the history and world war 2 🤷🏻‍♂️ https://twitter.com/hirokotabuchi/status/1239602529547300864 …
2020-03-17 02:03:00 UTC <i0n1c> I must say i am a bit puzzled by #Singapore travel banning europe but not US who are finally starting to get people tested and are already at over 4000 cases with potentially tens if thousands beint already infected.
2020-03-17 01:43:20 UTC <i0n1c> Just cancel the damn olympics. Maybe that makes them wake up. https://twitter.com/pinboard/status/1239727233347932160 …
2020-03-17 01:28:24 UTC <i0n1c> So starting today my hometown in #germany even closes restaurants. I guess this is required seeing how it spreads and people still not waking up.
2020-03-17 01:24:48 UTC <i0n1c> It is impossible to prevent someone like patient 31 who intentionally went to crowded areas to infect as many as possible. https://twitter.com/ExcludedMuddle/status/1239719454222630912 …
2020-03-16 04:09:07 UTC <i0n1c> Well the CEO of that company was US american. he really met POTUS to talk about vaccine beginning of March. Then one week later he was replaced as CEO without explanation by one of the founders of the company.
2020-03-16 02:32:55 UTC <i0n1c> I would urge social networks like @InterNationsorg to shutdown the ability to create offline events for a while.
2020-03-16 02:32:55 UTC <i0n1c> A bunch of members of @InterNationsorg are just nuts. They keep creating events to gather and meet in groups in public. And then the description says nonsense like:if you feel unwell don’t attend.When will it get into their heads that you can have and spread the virus long before
2020-03-16 01:21:05 UTC <i0n1c> Yeah i mentioned it in other tweet already - but it is officially unknown why he was replaced. So any guess to why is just a guess/hope
2020-03-18 13:03:50 UTC <elonmusk> Yeah. There was also an early engine shutdown on ascent, but it didn’t affect orbit insertion. Shows value of having 9 engines! Thorough investigation needed before next mission.

2020-03-17 03:34:13 UTC <elonmusk> That said, danger of panic still far exceeds danger of corona imo.

2020-03-17 16:51:04 UTC <Pwn20wnd> What is wrong with you? Why not just link my tweet instead of splitting it up in pieces and potentially causing misinformation?
2020-03-17 16:00:25 UTC <Pwn20wnd> Yes, system services will treat any process as if they have no entitlements if they lose CS_VALID.
2020-03-17 15:58:45 UTC <Pwn20wnd> You still lose CS_VALID if you invalidate your code signature on checkra1n.
2020-03-17 15:56:39 UTC <Pwn20wnd> (I will eventually write a new bootstrap tooling to take advantage of checkra1n’s nature... )
2020-03-17 15:53:16 UTC <Pwn20wnd> Give me your latest panic-full log.
2020-03-17 15:52:13 UTC <Pwn20wnd> Substrate resigns memory and burns vnodes to preserve the CS_VALID status in kernel but my Substitute bootstrap tooling just fakes it in the userspace instead.  It is entirely possible that u0 with Substitute performs better than CR with Substrate due that one reason.
2020-03-17 14:16:17 UTC <Pwn20wnd> I am giving away 2 packages of TP.  Post a screenshot of your device running Cydia with the hashtag #unc0ver to enter the giveaway.  The winner will be DM'd after a coronavirus vaccine is available.
2020-03-18 13:18:51 UTC <HuPing1> 如果你真的认为叫武汉肺炎就是错的就是歧视，我又早告诉过你“武汉肺炎”一说最先出自中国官媒，别人都是跟着学的。那么，你就该先批评中国政府，为什么最先叫武汉肺炎？带头污名化武汉人中国人，带头歧视武汉人中国人，还不赶快向武汉人向中国人认错道歉。只有做到这一点以后，你才有理由去要别人改口。 https://twitter.com/river8899/status/1240173473785237505 …

2020-03-18 05:58:21 UTC <HuPing1> 世卫的英文名字里哪有个“新”字？单从命名而言，新冠病毒肺炎这个名字都很不高明：如果明年又出了一种冠状病毒肺炎，你怎么叫？叫新新型冠状病毒肺炎吗？过几年又出一种，叫新新新型冠状病毒肺炎吗？接下来，新新新新型，新新新新新型，那还不把人搞胡涂了？ https://twitter.com/PHBb69LIcjMP3uV/status/1240153129053757440 …

2020-03-18 05:36:34 UTC <HuPing1> 对他的什么愤怒？又如何能转移到华裔头上？ https://twitter.com/guangyiwang/status/1239937905444843520 …
2020-03-18 05:03:21 UTC <HuPing1> 如果你真的认为这个病名有中国地名就是错的，我又早告诉过你“武汉肺炎”一说最先出自中国官媒，别人都是跟着学的。那么，你就该先批评中国政府，为什么最先叫武汉肺炎？带头污名化武汉人中国人，还不赶快向武汉人向中国人认错道歉。只有做到这一点以后，你才有理由去要求别人改口。
2020-03-18 04:56:14 UTC <HuPing1> 错。世卫命名的中文翻译是：2019冠状病毒病。我写的很清楚。赶快认错。 https://twitter.com/PHBb69LIcjMP3uV/status/1240139087576776704 …
2020-03-18 04:33:08 UTC <HuPing1> 既然你中国政府在绝大多数场合也没有采用世卫组织的命名，那你凭什么要求别人必须用世卫组织的命名呢？
2020-03-18 04:33:08 UTC <HuPing1> 中共官员说，既然世卫组织已经正式命名了，大家就都应该用世卫组织取的名字。不是的。中国政府自己就没有这么做嘛。查看中共官媒，例如人民日报，尤其是习近平的历次讲话，从来没有用过世卫组织取的那个“2019冠状病毒病”COVID-19名字，而总是把它叫做新冠肺炎或新型冠状病毒肺炎。
2020-03-18 04:11:05 UTC <HuPing1> 是的，昨天VOA节目里，章立凡就提到克山病。此病因首先发现于黑龙江克山县而得名。这个名字可是中国人自己取的，到现在一点没有改名的意思。 https://twitter.com/jsmiaopu/status/1240125860545519616 …
2020-03-18 03:27:18 UTC <HuPing1> 再看看亚利桑那山谷热这种传染病。这种病是去掉地名好还是有地名好？ZT：方励之生前谈他得的怪病：亚利桑那山谷热 。 链接： https://bbs.wenxuecity.com/backhome/718650.html …
2020-03-18 03:15:37 UTC <HuPing1> 我恰恰说的是和命名没什么关系嘛。 https://twitter.com/shida_chen/status/1240114183431208960 …
2020-03-18 03:08:31 UTC <HuPing1> 世卫新规定也不赞成用人名命名传染病，以免污名化、歧视性联想。可是，麻风病被医学界叫做汉森病，纪念麻风杆菌发现者挪威医生汉森，沙门氏菌也是以首位发现者沙门命名。这分明是极大的荣耀。不准用人名命名，等于是剥夺了这种人获得一种荣耀的机会。也未必都是好作用呢。
2020-03-18 03:08:30 UTC <HuPing1> 世卫组织2015年的新规定未必高明。是否带来歧视性联想和命名并无多大关系。中国政府除了早期用过武汉肺炎外，一直到现在都用的是新冠病毒。但是就是在中国，对武汉人的歧视还少了吗？很多人只因身份证上有武汉，买机票高铁入住旅馆都被排斥。网上这种故事太多了。 https://twitter.com/shida_chen/status/1240107636407713792 …

2020-03-18 02:36:29 UTC <HuPing1> 特朗普说的中国病毒，原文是：Chinese Virus. 又，德国麻疹，英文是：German measles （不是Germany measles） 日本脑炎，英文是：Japanese encephalitis（不是Japan encephalitis） 在讨论污名化问题时，先要弄清楚一些事实。
2020-03-17 23:21:45 UTC <HuPing1> CDC明明说的是现在（today）。美国、欧洲，也包括中国，都可能有人由于没得到核酸检测，未被确诊为新冠病毒，就死了，就当作一般流感或肺炎，而实际上是死于新冠。这和明知是死于新冠，但否认或隐瞒，谎称死于流感或肺炎，根本是两回事。 https://twitter.com/arvinsummer/status/1240039328853536768 …

2020-03-17 19:47:15 UTC <DongFang_USA> 美国之音并没有幸免于难。中共对美国媒体实施三条报复措施，第一条制裁了五家，美国之音首当其冲。第二条惩罚措施，也就是吊销记者证，暂时针对三家美国驻华媒体，分别是纽约时报，华盛顿邮报和华尔街日报。对中共来说，美国官方媒体和私营媒体的区别，似乎没有那么重要，都是境外反华势力的一部分。 https://twitter.com/QiaoMoo/status/1239963614741585920 …

2020-03-17 18:43:34 UTC <DongFang_USA> 1. 记者证和记者签证不是一回事。记者证是外交部发给外媒驻京记者的证件，我们凭此证进入外交部、国新办等参加新闻发布会。记者签证（J类签证）由公安部门签发在外媒记者的护照上，常驻记者签证有效期只到年底。 2. 我的理解是所有美籍记者的记者证有效期和护照上J 类签证的有效期互为对应，年底到期。 https://twitter.com/junl2004/status/1239983227588112384 …
2020-03-17 18:32:01 UTC <DongFang_USA> 以川普总统的个性以及白宫中对华鹰派占据主地位的情势，美方势必对中共驻美国的官媒实施更加强硬、广泛的制裁措施。 https://twitter.com/PDChinese/status/1239956422760321026 …
2020-03-17 18:29:26 UTC <DongFang_USA> 中国政府制裁美国媒体并没有把美国之音排除在外。中方第一条制裁措施针对五家媒体，美国之音名列前茅。 ”中方对等要求“美国之音”、《纽约时报》、《华尔街日报》、《华盛顿邮报》、《时代周刊》这5家美国媒体驻华分社向中方申报在中国境内所有工作人员、财务、经营、所拥有不动产信息等书面材料。“
2020-03-17 18:26:27 UTC <DongFang_USA> 根据我在北京任VOA驻华记者的经验，中国政府给所有外媒常驻记者都是一年签证，年底到期后需要申请顺延。这三家媒体的记者虽然在十天内把记者证交回去了，但中国政府给他们的一年有效的驻华长期记者签证是否被立即吊销，并不明确。目前不知道他们是否可以根据手中的有效签证呆在北京至年底。
2020-03-17 18:26:27 UTC <DongFang_USA> 有报道称中共驱逐纽约时报，华尔街日报，华盛顿邮报，时代周刊和美国之音驻京记者，限制十天内离开中国。我的理解是，中共目前要求纽时，华邮和华尔街日报的驻京分社在四天之内向外交部提交年底前记者证到期的所有工作人员的名单，并在十天内交出外国驻华记者的记者证，今后不得从事记者工作。
2020-03-17 17:01:24 UTC <DongFang_USA> 长期以来，中方对外国驻华记者采取各种限制措施，这次美中两国互相驱逐记者的事件升级，是不是因为中国先动手，驱逐了三名华尔街日报记者而引发的？ https://twitter.com/SpokespersonCHN/status/1239941366026612742 …
2020-03-17 16:35:50 UTC <DongFang_USA> 第三，针对美方对中国记者在签证、行政审查、采访等方面采取歧视性限制措施，中方将对美国记者采取对等措施。 中共外交部还称：中方上述措施完全是对美方无理打压中国媒体驻美机构被迫进行的必要对等反制，完全是正当合理防卫。如果美方一意孤行，错上加错，中方也必将采取进一步的反制措施。
2020-03-17 16:35:50 UTC <DongFang_USA> 第二，针对美方大幅削减、实际驱逐中国媒体驻美机构员工，中方要求《纽约时报》、《华尔街日报》、《华盛顿邮报》年底前记者证到期的美籍记者从即日起4天内向外交部新闻司申报名单，并于10天内交还记者证，今后不得在中华人民共和国，包括香港、澳门特别行政区继续从事记者工作。
2020-03-17 16:35:50 UTC <DongFang_USA> 突发新闻：中国对美国驻华记者采取报复措施，有观察人士认为美中两国已进入准冷战状态。中国外交部宣布，从即日起， 第一，中方对等要求“美国之音”、纽约时报、华尔街日报、华盛顿邮报、时代周刊这5家美国媒体驻华分社向中方申报在中国境内所有工作人员、财务、经营、所拥有不动产信息等书面材料。
2020-03-17 16:20:46 UTC <DongFang_USA> 针对大量爱国小粉红蜂拥回国，有报道称国内民众打出欢迎标语：国家有难你不在，千里投毒你第一。

2020-03-17 10:57:37 UTC <CStar_OW> 2. I have protections against TOCTOU that I won’t discuss 3. Nope, it doesn’t allow running binaries
2020-03-17 10:46:41 UTC <CStar_OW> 1. iOS 10 and lower use the same version of ldid as the current build of ldid that I distribute 2. Pirates can more easily break the DRM if only those 2 are hashed by editing the Mach header if I don’t hash the entire thing 3. The modification would be converting it to PHP...
2020-03-17 10:19:59 UTC <CStar_OW> The binary would be pre-signed if I could run ldid on my server. AGPL is why I can’t distribute pre-signed binaries, and why ldid needs to run on the user’s device
2020-03-17 10:10:40 UTC <CStar_OW> well that's a problem with ldid being AGPL then. Otherwise I'd run it on my server and not require the user's device to run ldid at all
