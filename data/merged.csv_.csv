353	2020-06-07 05:47:47	<HuPing1> 必须迅速对对别人作出判断，以便决定我们用什么态度去对待他们。在这种情况下，我们就只好贴标签了。我们就只好根据某些简单的、一目了然的标记或线索进行归类，再根据我们的知识和经验，匆匆地给别人做出评判。肤色既然是最容易看到的标记，这就怪不得人们往往会根据肤色做评判了。这实在是很无奈的。
354	2020-06-07 05:47:47	<HuPing1> 然而在今天，我们生活的世界太大了，我们与之打交道的人，绝大多数是陌生人；我们不断地与之不同程度互动的，是那些我们了解很少、甚至见都没见过的人，而且这些互动常常是一辈子也只有一两次。对于这千千万万的陌生人或者半生不熟的人，我们无法看清他们的品格；但是在很多情境下，生活又要求我们
355	2020-06-07 05:47:47	<HuPing1> 原因很简单。看肤色很容易，一眼就看见了，想不看见都不行。看清一个人的品格何其难。如果不靠特殊的情境和事件，那就需要长期的近身接触。如果我们生活在熟人社会，大家都朝夕相处，彼此都知根知底，我们比较容易做到，不是根据皮肤的颜色，而是根据品格的优劣来评判别人以及被别人评判。
356	2020-06-07 05:47:47	<HuPing1> 歧视即偏见，偏见就是以偏概全之见。马丁.路德.金说：“我梦想有一天，我的四个孩子将生活在一个不是以皮肤的颜色，而是以品格的优劣作为评判标准的国家里。”这话说得多好啊。我相信我们很多人都会真心赞同。问题是，即使我们真心赞同，可是在实际生活中也很难做得到。 https://twitter.com/xiaoweirose/status/1269493778533900288 …

80	2020-06-07 05:20:40	<zhanglifan> 1，戴高乐出亡时是次长，准将军衔。只当抵抗运动领袖，不自称流亡政府，是他当时的身份地位决定的。 2，多数国家当时承认的是与德国合作的维希政府，只有英国扶持并将其视为流亡政府。 3，“自由法国”有海外领土，有武装力量，有国内民众支持，不是流亡者的“口炮党”，是它能演变为法国临时政府的基础。
357	2020-06-07 05:20:16	<HuPing1> 同样是白人为主体的国家，少数族裔，包括黑人，也包括华人，在美国的处境不是更差而是更好。不要说奥巴马选上总统不说明问题，那为什么这事就发生在美国，别的国家连影子都没看见？并非总是压迫越深反抗越烈，有时是反过来的。
359	2020-06-07 05:20:15	<HuPing1> 如果我们对人类持一种清醒的现实的态度，正视人性的种种弱点，我们就不能不承认，要让世人彻底克服种族偏见几乎是不可能的（想想你自己和你的朋友有几个能做到），我们充其量只能建立一种肯定种族平等的制度和法律，形成一种肯定种族平等的主流舆论，限制种族歧视的恶性发作，减少公开的种族歧视现象。
358	2020-06-07 05:20:15	<HuPing1> 这次，三个前总统都大发议论，但是并没有提出什么改革方案。因为在体制上法律上能做的差不多都做了，进一步改革的空间不是没有，但很有限。要彻底解决问题，唯有分立分治。只要外观上有明显差异的种族共存于一个国家，顶多能在体制上法律上做到平等，但隐性的歧视无法消除。
